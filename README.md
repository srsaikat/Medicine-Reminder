A medicine reminder with cycled treatment support

## Introduction

A medicine reminder provides more advanced ways of scheduling your medicine intakes with the innovative treatment cycle support.

If you ever got yourself into a treatment that has e.g. six two-week cycles, where you're instructed to take medicine A for the first two days of each cycle, B for the following eight days, C every other day and D everyday, I bet you'll need some extra aspirins against the headache it causes to schedule all these with Google Calendar.

However, with Nevermind, such type of "on-and-off" scheduling becomes simpler.

## Features

### Treatment cycle support

When enabled, starting and stopping date of a medicine are scheduled according to cycle settings.

A treatment can be set to recur either for certain times, or until a certain date.

### Starting and stopping of the intake

When Treatment cycle is enabled, intake starts on the first day of a cycle by default. Or it can be set to start after delaying for certain period in each cycle.

The stopping date, on the other hand, is the same day as the cycle ends by default, or set to be in a certain period after starting.

### Which days, which hours

A medicine can be scheduled by:
  - Certain hours of day
  - Certain times a day (coming soon)
  - Every n hours (coming soon)

, on
  - Everyday
  - Every n days
  - Days of week (coming soon)
